Nice — below is a self-contained minimal implementation of Step 1: Initialization (GUI + Setup) and the wiring between the GUI → Controller → DB → Watcher → Analyzer → Protector. This code focuses on:

GUI where user enters Master Password, adds watch folders, starts/stops monitoring.

Controller that initializes DB, Analyzer, Protector, and starts the Watchdog observer thread.

Simple DB, crypto utilities, watcher, analyzer, and protector (backup-only for now).

You can run this locally after installing the dependencies. It’s ready to extend for the rest of the features (entropy checks, process-kill, alerts, restore/decrypt UI, etc.).
